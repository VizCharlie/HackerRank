Consider two sets of positive integers, A = {a0, a1,..., a(n-1)} and B = {b0, b1,..., b(m-1)}. We say that a positive integer, x, is between sets A and B if the following conditions are satisfied:

    All elements in are factors of x.
    x is a factor of all elements in B.

In other words, some x is between A and B if that value of x satisfies (x)mod(ai) = 0 for every ai in A and also satisfies (bi)mod(x) for every bi in B. For example, if A = {2 , 6} and B = {12}, then our possible x values are 4, 6 and 12.

Given A and B, find and print the number of integers (i.e., possible x's) that are between the two sets.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of n(the number of elements in set A) and m(the number of elements in set B).
The second line contains n distinct space-separated integers describing a0, a1,..., a(n-1).
The third line contains m distinct space-separated integers describing b0, b1,..., b(m-1).

Constraints
    1 <= n, m <= 10
    1 <= ai <= 100
    1 <= bi <= 100
Output Format

Print the number of integers that are considered to be between A and B.

Sample Input

2 3
2 4
16 32 96

Sample Output

3

Explanation

There are three x values between A = {2, 4} and B = {16, 32, 96}:

    x = 4:
        All the elements in A evenly divide x = 4.
        x = 4 evenly divides all the elements in B.
    x = 8:
        All the elements in A evenly divide x = 8.
        x = 8 evenly divides all the elements in B.
    x = 16:
        All the elements in A evenly divide x = 16.
        x = 16 evenly divides all the elements in B.

Thus, we print 3 as our answer.
